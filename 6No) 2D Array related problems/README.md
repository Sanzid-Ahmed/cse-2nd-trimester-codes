# 2D Array Problems – Second Trimester Archive

This folder contains practice programs and assignments related to **2D Arrays** in the C programming language, as part of my **Second Trimester coursework** at UIU.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

These problems help in understanding and mastering:

- Declaring and initializing 2D arrays
- Taking input/output from 2D arrays
- Row-wise and column-wise traversal
- Matrix operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Transpose
- Searching within a matrix
- Finding sum of rows, columns, diagonals
- Pattern printing using 2D arrays

## 📁 Example Files

- `matrix_input_output.c` – Basic I/O operations in 2D arrays
- `matrix_sum.c` – Sum of two matrices
- `matrix_multiplication.c` – Multiply two matrices
- `diagonal_sum.c` – Find the sum of diagonals
- `transpose_matrix.c` – Transpose of a matrix
- `search_element.c` – Search for an element in a matrix

## 🚀 How to Run

Use a C compiler like GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
